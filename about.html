        <h5>Steelbird Profile <span></span></h5>
          <p>With global domination of more than 50 years and the inspiration to protect bike lovers and adventure enthusiasts all over the world, Steelbird Hi-Tech India Ltd. (SBHT) was founded on 13th March 1964. SBHT, a flagship company of Steelbird Group of Industries, ventured into the unknown territory of auto accessory business to manufacture helmets.
 
            From humble beginnings come great achievements. Leaving behind the savagery of partition, Mr. Subhash Kapur, a man of exceptional business acumen spearheaded his efforts to turn a small time family business into a multimillion dollar empire with exports spreading across 50 nations like Brazil, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Kenya, Tanzania, Egypt, Vietnam, Bahrain, Dubai, Nepal, Colombia, Uruguay and other European countries. SBHT has already embarked on real estate business, entertainment and is also actively involved in organizing motorsports events on a regular basis.

SBHT specializes as an OEM to top-notch clients as Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Royal Enfield. Customers can now buy SBHT products directly via mobile optimized online store.

            In technical collaboration with global giants like Composites, Bieffe and AD Engineering, Italy, SBHT has cutting edge manufacturing facility in all 6 of its plants and the largest one is in Baddi (Himachal Pradesh), near Chandigarh with over one hundred and fifty thousand Sq. ft. of covered area. SBHT has installed capacity of 22000 Helmets per day and 1600 Side Boxes (Pannier Box) per day. To achieve this capacity, SBHT has deployed a fleet of latest Equipments, Injection Moulding Machines, Automatic Robotic Visor Lines, and Balloon Moulding Machines. SBHT has a complete range of 51 Helmet models and 17 Pannier Boxes models, each having 3 to 9 colour variants.

To reach nation-wide potential customers, SBHT has opened RiderZ Shopee.
            
            SBHT has 4 major brands- Steelbird, Ares, Steelbird Air & Ignyte. Air Helmet and Ignyte Accessories have been launched very recently. Ares is a premium brand of SBHT manufactured in collaboration with OUTLAST, NASA certified technology. Steelbird Air is another world class brand crafted with revolutionary ventilation system. Ignyte is a compact kit bag of biking accessories. Both Steelbird Air and Ignyte were launched on 11th April 2015, at Steelbird Awards Ceremony. Their genesis is based on requirements of a nation with tropical climatic conditions.
            
            Yesteryears' heavy, hot and uncomfortable helmets were replaced with SBHT helmets that are light, comfortable and cool. Now the most important aspect of bike safety comes with the freedom to jump, run and flip some crazy stunts for a terrific ride.
